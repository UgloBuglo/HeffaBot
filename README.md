A delta 3D printer built around a frame of 30x30 BoschRexroth aluminium profiles.

Instead of the "normal" triangular delta printer shape I built the frame using six 60Â° angular profiles as uprights, in effect creating a hexagon shaped delta printer.
The carriages for the delta arms run along three OpenBuild V-Slot profiles located in the three smaller "windows" of the frame. The carriages themself are also from OpenBuild - the 20mm V-Plate running on 4 x Solid V-Wheels each.
